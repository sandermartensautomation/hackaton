Feature: ContactForm

  Scenario: Sending a filled in contact form should result is a success message
  Given I'm on the Polteq TestShop
  When I send a contact form
    | subject   | email address   | reference  | message      |
    | Webmaster | tester@test.com | 0987654321 | Some message |
  Then I should get a confirmation that the contact form has been sent
